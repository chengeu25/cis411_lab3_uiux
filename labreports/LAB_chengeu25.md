caption: The homepage has a very clean layout with good organisation of recommended employers. I like that it has the feature to attend events that are relevant to my career. I could navigate to Messiah University's resources very easily too  (URL: https://messiah.joinhandshake.com/stu)

caption: Adding job experiences is straightforward but not as intuitive as I would have liked. I have navigate down the page to find a small button - "Add work experience". I had to look around to find that button = time wasted.

caption: Handshake need to do a better job in dynamically updating job listing that are already closed. LinkedIn does this well. As you can see, the job listing was already closed but it was still listed on Hadnshake. This has happened quite often.
